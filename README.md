# VPN-Fix
This is another PowerShell script that I wrote that fixes a common networking issue experienced by users at my current workplace. Ocassionally, remote employees will report that their VPN connection is constantly dropping and/or experiencing slower than normal speeds. After working with our Network Engineer, he recommended some steps that basically involves resetting the virtual network adapter, deleting various registry entries and reinstalling our VPN software among other things. Of course, I decided to automate these steps, because...why not?? :)
